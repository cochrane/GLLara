title: What is GLLara?
author: cochrane

GLLara is a Mac OS X tool to create 3D scenes and take pictures of them, like this:

When you run it, it looks like this:

The whole thing is a reimplementation of [XNALara by Dusan](http://www.tombraiderforums.com/showthread.php?t=147100), which did the same thing before on Windows. GLLara is partly based on it and is (hopefully) compatible with all the files XNALara uses. There's also [XPS](http://xnalara.home-forum.com/), which continues the XNALara development. GLLara attempts to be compatible with files for that as well.

To use GLLara, look in the help system, which covers everything I could think of.

System requirements
-------------------

Any Mac with OS X 12.3 or higher should work. However, there appear to be some problems, sometimes, on ones with Intel HD 4000 graphics cards. Especially more complicated models may cause problems there.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

### Are you going to make a Linux version?

Nope. Anyone who wants to try is free to do so, but since this is all Objective-C and Swift, I think they might be better of just using this for inspiration and rewriting much of it in C++. I can help with any questions about the file format.

### Where can I get models?

Various places; just search for `xnalara models`, they will work in GLLara as well.

### Something doesn't work!

File a bug report in the issue tracker. It requires a Github account, but that is free. If you have problems with a particular model, please include the link where you got it from!
