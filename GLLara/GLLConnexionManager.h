 * Manager that listens to inputs on a 3D or "space" mouse device, if any is
 * connected, and provides its values to the program. They are processed by
 * the GLLView.
 *
 * These devices are rare but fun. The class uses the interface from Connexion
 * (these days the only manufacturer). Since that is C and is dynamically
 * loaded, this class is Objective C, as a rare exception for newer files.
