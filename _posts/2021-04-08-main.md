For those of you who have a clone of the repository, please note that I've changed the name of the main development branch of GLLara from "master" to "main". This is something that a lot of open source projects are doing in order to foster a more inclusive environment. While GLLara is not exactly a project with a huge active community that is going to notice, doing the right thing here is easy and doesn't cost anything.

Note, however, that this means you have to update your local branch if you do have a cloned version of the repository lying somewhere around. You can find instructions on how to do that e.g. [here](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/git-rename-master-to-main/). In general this is a simple operation that doesn't take long and doesn't actually change anything about your workflow.
